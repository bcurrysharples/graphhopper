&nbsp;/**
&nbsp; * Detects and marks &#39;subnetworks&#39; with a dedicated subnetwork encoded value. Subnetworks are parts of the road network
&nbsp; * that are not connected to the rest of the network and that are below a certain size. These can be isolated nodes with
&nbsp; * no edges at all, but also small subnetworks which could be bugs in OSM data or &#39;islands&#39; that are separated from
&nbsp; * the rest of the network because of some missing link, barrier or some closed road for example.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Sometimes there are also subnetworks that can be reached from the main network but not the other way around (or the
&nbsp; * opposite). For example this can be parking lots that can only be accessed by a single one-way road (a mapping error).
&nbsp; * These are called &#39;one-way subnetworks&#39; and are marked using the same subnetwork encoded value, see #86. To find such
&nbsp; * one-way subnetworks it is important to search for strongly connected components on the directed graph and not do a
&nbsp; * simple connectivity check for one direction.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * Note that it depends on the weighting whether or not edges belong to a subnetwork or not. For example if a weighting
&nbsp; * &#39;closes&#39; a bridge to an island the island might become a subnetwork, but if the bridge was open it would belong to
&nbsp; * the main network. There can even be subnetworks that are due to turn restrictions.
&nbsp; * &lt;p&gt;
&nbsp; * We always run an edge-based connected component search, because this way we retrieve the edges (not the nodes) that
&nbsp; * belong to each component and can include turn restrictions as well. Node-based component search is faster, but since
&nbsp; * the subnetwork search goes relatively fast anyway using it has no real benefit.
